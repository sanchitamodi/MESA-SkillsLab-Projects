# MESA-SkillsLab-Projects
This repository contains my original code and projects from the MESA Skills Lab program. These labs/workshops were designed to build foundational programming skills, problem-solving, and computational thinking for participating MESA students.

PURPOSE
These projects were developed to support hands-on Skills Lab workshops, helping students build practical experience in programming and AI concepts through guided labs. 

LABS AND WORKSHOP MATERIALS
These projects were accompanied by workshop manuals used in the Skills Lab sessions.
- Lab01: Statistics Calulator
- Lab02: 2-Player Tic-Tac-Toe
